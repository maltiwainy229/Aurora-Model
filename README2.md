# My Project Portfolio: Microsoft Aurora Model

## Overview

This repository documents my project work using [Microsoft's Aurora model](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora), a state-of-the-art foundation model for weather and climate. My goal is to make my process fully public and reproducible—a portfolio showing every step, from setup to results and reflections.

## Reference to Aurora

The core of this project is based on Microsoft's Aurora model, available at [github.com/microsoft/aurora](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora). Much of the pipeline—including the use of the `example_era5.ipynb` notebook—was adapted directly from their public repository and documentation. Please refer to their [official documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora#documentation) for detailed information about the model, its capabilities, and setup instructions.

## Step-by-Step Documentation

This repo is structured as a step-by-step portfolio, including:

1. **Cloning Aurora and Environment Setup**  
   - Instructions for cloning this repo and the Aurora repo (if desired)  
   - Environment setup and dependencies

2. **Running the Pipeline**  
   - How I used (and minimally modified) `example_era5.ipynb` from Aurora  
   - Steps to reproduce results

3. **Validation and Reproducibility**  
   - How I validated my results against those in the Aurora repo  
   - Notes on reproducibility and any challenges encountered

4. **Modifications and Extensions**  
   - Any experiments, tweaks, or extensions I performed beyond the original pipeline

5. **Results & Reflection**  
   - Summary of my outputs and comparisons  
   - Reflections on working with Aurora and lessons learned (as included in my poster)

## Results & Reflection

Towards the end of this documentation (and in my poster), you will find a section summarizing results and personal reflections, highlighting reproducibility, strengths and challenges of using Aurora, and ideas for future work.

## Portfolio/Showcase Purpose

This repository is intended as a public portfolio—a well-documented, organized showcase of my project work with Microsoft Aurora. Anyone interested should be able to follow the steps here to reproduce my process, understand my findings, and potentially build upon them.

## Usage Instructions

- Follow the step-by-step guides in the notebooks and markdown files.
- Refer to the [Aurora documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora#documentation) for model details and advanced usage.
