# Extras Folder

This folder contains miscellaneous files that may be of interest:

- `AuroraPT.ipynb`: Model weights for [Aurora 0.25Â° Pretrained model](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora/models.html).
- `ncdump.ipynb` : nc dump operations, Xarray inspections, and more
- `testing.ipynb` : A load of extra random scripts I didn't need for my final project. Includes plots of different surface and atmospheric variables, aproximated 3D vectors, debugging, and a whole lot of errors. This is my way of showing vulnerability and my messiness.
