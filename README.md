# Aurora-Model

This repository documents my work using [Microsoft's Aurora](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aurora-forecasting/) model, a state-of-the-art foundation model for weather and climate, with initial steps based on the official Aurora notebooks and further experimentation on the EMARS dataset.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maltiwainy229/Aurora-Model.git
cd Aurora-Model
```

To use the original Aurora code, also clone their repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/aurora.git
cd aurora
```
See [Aurora's documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/aurora/intro.html) for setup and installation instructions.

## Notebooks Folder

- `notebooks/example_era5.ipynb`: Based on Aurora's official example, used for initial exploration and data preparation.
- `notebooks/EMARSpredictions.ipynb`: My notebook for running predictions on the EMARS dataset using Aurora's workflow.
